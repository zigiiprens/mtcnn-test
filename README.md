# MTCNN-TEST
## Description
This repository aims to test the MTCNN package from Pypi https://pypi.org/project/mtcnn/

## Installation
We, for now, advice to clone this repository in your Projects folder and then run
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Make sure you have installed all the required packages or this will not work properly.
If needed, you can use an virtual env manager as:
* `venv`
* `pipenv`
* `conda`

## Folders
In the `mtcnn-test` project repository, you will need an extra folder inside as:
* `data`

Make sure to move an image in the `data` folder and rename it as `face.jpg`

## Run the magic
Finally, you will just need to run the following code with a simple line as:
* `python FaceDetection.py --image <path>`

and see the Magic.
